    <!-- How to spice up your dessert menu-->
            
            <p> If you are a little fancier then just some cookies, you could always serve a desert nice and warm so when you add ice cream it will be the perfect temperature. You could always have a variety of different things. For example, instead of just chocolate chip cookies you could add some oatmeal raisen, or M&amp;M cookies. By having a variety of different desserts, you could satisfy more people with the different choices.</p>
